## Beam College Day 1 Assets

This directory contains the assets for day 1 of Beam College.

It currently has:
 * Slides for session 1 (Welcome, overview and business cases)
 * Slides for session 2 (Beam Model)
 * Slides for session 3 (Describe a Pipeline Declaratively - DAG) 
 * Python for the Demo.

If you open the Python any of the notebooks in GitHub, you should get a link to launch them in Google Colab 
so that you do not need to install anything locally.

If you have trouble launching the Colab from GitHub, you can open it directly from here:
